This project was completed in 2019 for my Knowledge Discovery from Data class. I worked on a team with Josh Abel, Daniel DeFoe, and Sam Verkruyse. For this project, we created a chatbot that took in a user question regarding CS professors at Cal Poly, pulled an answer from our web-scraped database on the topic, and responded to the user answering their question. To do this, we first predicted the specific topic of the question (e.g. research interests, contact information, student ratings) with a support vector machine, then translated the question into a SQL query with by-hand NLP in a topic-specific pipeline, then used a simple grammar template to put together an English answer. This bot can run on the command line or respond to posts on Reddit.
