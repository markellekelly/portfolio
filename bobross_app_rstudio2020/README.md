This project was created for and won the 2019 Cal Poly Shiny Contest, in connection with the 2020 RStudio Conference. I worked with Ashley Jacobson. We created an R Shiny app that explores the 538 Bob Ross dataset, featured on Tidy Tuesday. This app can be found live at: https://markelle.shinyapps.io/bobross-shinyapp/

**Exemplifies skills in**: R Shiny apps, exploratory data analysis
