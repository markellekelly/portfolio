    "This project takes a close look at United States Permanent Visa Applications submitted between 2012 and 2017. An exploratory data analysis examines which employers and industries are bringing in the most immigrants, where these immigrants are moving to, and where they are coming from. It also begins to investigate which factors are correlated with visa approval. For my challenge area, I looked at several methods of topic extraction for text columns about applicants' jobs and industries, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation and two models of non-negative matrix factorization. Finally, this project aims to predict whether visa applications will be approved or denied using logistic regression and machine learning."
