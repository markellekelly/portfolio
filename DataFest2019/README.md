This project was completed for the 2019 UCLA DataFest, where it won Best Visualization. I worked on a team with Nicole Hill, James Kao, Evan Shui, and Jenna Landy. Teams were given two days to work and find insight on a dataset on exertion in women's rugby. We performed exploratory data analysis and experimented with several modeling techniques.
